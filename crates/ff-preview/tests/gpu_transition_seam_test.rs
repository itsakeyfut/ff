//! The preview runner routes a transition through the injected GPU seam (#1726).
//!
//! `ff-render` depends on this crate, so the runner can only reach a GPU transition node
//! through [`PreviewCompositor`]. This drives the **real** `SceneRunner` over a two-clip
//! transition with an injected blender and asserts the runner used what it returned.
//!
//! The blender answers with a colour no cross-fade of the source could produce, so a run
//! that quietly stayed on `apply_xfade` cannot satisfy the assertion — that is the point
//! of the test, and the reason it does not simply compare against a CPU blend.
//!
//! No adapter is involved: this pins the *seam*, not the GPU. `avio`'s
//! `gpu_preview_transition_test` covers the real nodes, probe-gated.
//!
//! The fixture places its two clips back to back and gives the outgoing one a
//! `video_handle`, which is the shape `avio` now derives (ADR-0009). It used to overlap
//! them instead, because without a handle the runner advanced to the incoming clip
//! before it could arm the blend and the seam was reached 0 times — that was #1737, and
//! a fixture the engine never produced was hiding it (RK-015).
//!
//! The runner is driven unpaced (#1757, ADR-0015): the transition window is
//! `[1200, 1600)`ms and the sink stops after 40 frames, so the seam is offered exactly
//! the four frames at 1200, 1233, 1267 and 1300ms. Paced to the wall clock, a loaded
//! runner dropped the whole window and `blends` read 0.
//!
//! Probe-gated (RK-002): skips when the shared asset cannot be opened.
