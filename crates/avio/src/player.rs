//! Timeline-facing real-time preview entry point.
//!
//! [`TimelinePlayer`] is the engine-level bridge from the editing model to the
//! primitive preview runner: it derives a [`Scene`](ff_preview::Scene) from a
//! [`Timeline`] and hands it to [`ff_preview::ScenePlayer`], which owns the
//! decode pipelines and audio mixer. The runner itself
//! ([`SceneRunner`](ff_preview::SceneRunner)) stays in `ff-preview` as a
//! model-agnostic `Scene` consumer.

/// The filter path refuses `In`/`Out`/`Atop`/`Xor` when its graph is built (#1753,
/// ADR-0014), and the runner then shows the base frame with that layer missing. So a
/// timeline that needs one of them is refused here, before any decoding starts,
/// whenever no GPU compositor is attached. Checked on the model rather than the
/// derived scene so the message can name the track and clip, but with the same
/// track-activity rule the derivation applies: a disabled, muted or solo-shadowed
/// track contributes no layer, so an operator there is never built and must not
/// refuse the timeline. Every active layer counts, the base included: the CPU
/// compositor used to ignore the base layer's operator while the GPU applies it
/// against an empty backdrop, which is its own silent divergence.
