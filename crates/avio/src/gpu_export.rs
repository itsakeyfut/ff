//! GPU export path: a deterministic decode -> GPU composite -> readback -> encode
//! loop for an eligible timeline (bridge Br4, #1627).
//!
//! The offline compositor ([`MultiTrackComposer`](ff_filter::MultiTrackComposer))
//! fuses decode and composite in one filter graph and never exposes a per-layer
//! frame, so the GPU export cannot reuse it. Instead this module decodes each clip's
//! source directly ([`ff_decode::VideoDecoder`]), composites each output frame on the
//! GPU via the shared [`GpuCompositor`](crate::gpu_compositor::GpuCompositor), reads
//! it back to rgba, and pushes it to the unchanged encoder (whose own sws converts
//! rgba -> yuv420p).
//!
//! The route takes a **single active video track** at unity speed whose every clip is a
//! file source. Several restrictions the first version had are gone: a source whose frame
//! rate differs from the timeline's is conformed by the drain (#1660), one whose size
//! differs from the canvas sits at its native size on it like every layer (ADR-0016), a
//! **cross-fade at any boundary** is rendered by the drain rather than rejected (#1659),
//! and a clip carrying a position or scale is placed by the shared core in canvas space,
//! the CPU composer's own geometry (ADR-0016; see `gpu_compositor::layer_transform`). A
//! rotated clip, and a cross-fade between two clips of which either is placed, still take
//! the CPU route.
//!
//! What still keeps the whole export on the CPU `MultiTrackComposer` path (see
//! [`eligible_track`]): more than one active video track, a lavfi overlay, a generated
//! (non-file) source, a speed other than 1, clips that do not tile the timeline, and a
//! transition whose kind or window the GPU cannot render. Multi-track / overlay GPU
//! export is #1633's remaining half.
