//! The preview reaches its transition on a scene the *engine* derived (#1737).
//!
//! The runner arms a transition only while the outgoing clip is still producing frames
//! at the incoming clip's offset. Before ADR-0009 the engine derived clips that met
//! exactly (`overlap = 0 ns`), so the runner advanced to the incoming clip first and the
//! blend was never offered: measured 0 calls, against 13 for a hand-built overlapping
//! scene. The preview showed a hard cut wherever the export wrote a cross-fade, and
//! `ff-preview`'s seam suite passed the whole time because its fixture was a shape the
//! engine did not produce (RK-015).
//!
//! So this drives the **real** runner over a **`Timeline::to_scene`** derivation, and
//! counts. The injected compositor declines every blend (returns `None`), leaving the
//! runner on its own CPU path: what is asserted is that the transition *armed*, not what
//! it rendered. `xfade_reference_parity` owns the pixels.
//!
//! Probe-gated (RK-002): skips when the environment cannot encode or open the preview.
//! Its source files are keyed to this suite, so it is safe at default parallelism
//! (RK-019).
