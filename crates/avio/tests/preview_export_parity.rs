//! Preview-vs-export structural parity for the supported set (#1664).
//!
//! The bridge renders a timeline two ways — the real-time preview runner
//! (`TimelinePlayer` -> `SceneRunner` -> `FrameSink`) and the export path
//! (`Timeline::render` -> encoded file). #1663 pinned GPU-vs-CPU parity per effect;
//! this pins that the two *pipelines* agree on the shape of what they produce, now
//! that both derive from the same single `Clip::effects` list (#1622 / #1712).
//!
//! # What is guaranteed here
//!
//! - Both sides produce frames at the timeline's canvas size.
//! - The export decodes to the expected frame count for the timeline's duration and
//!   frame rate.
//! - The preview's delivered presentation timestamps cover most of the timeline, so it
//!   plays substantially the same span the export writes. Not the exact end: the runner
//!   is real-time and drops late frames, the tail included (see the third boundary below).
//! - Both sides render the source's (chromatic) colour rather than a blank frame, and
//!   agree with each other within a coarse tolerance.
//!
//! # The deferred full-convergence boundary
//!
//! Per-pixel convergence between preview and export is **out of scope for v0.18** and
//! is deliberately not asserted, for two reasons that this test cannot remove:
//!
//! 1. **Colour space.** The preview composites in rgba, while the export normalises to
//!    `yuv420p` before compositing (RK-012), so identical inputs land on different
//!    numbers — the reason the tolerance here is coarse rather than tight.
//! 2. **Lossy encode.** The export is compared *after* an H.264 encode/decode round
//!    trip, which perturbs pixels independently of any compositing difference.
//!
//! A third reason used to be real-time playback: the runner dropped frames under load,
//! so the preview side could only be asserted by the span it covered. The runner is
//! driven unpaced here (`Pacing::Unpaced`, #1757, ADR-0015), which delivers every
//! frame, so the preview leg is now compared by frame count like the export leg.
//! Closing the remaining gap needs the two compositors to share a colour space.
//!
//! Probe-gated (RK-002): the source encode, the preview open and the export each skip
//! gracefully when the environment cannot run them, so the suite stays green on a
//! minimal-`FFmpeg` CI. Only environment-unavailable errors are skipped; a structural
//! failure (an export that decodes to nothing, a colour mismatch) fails the test.
//!
//! The source is a **file** clip encoded by the fixture helper, not a generated
//! (`Solid`) clip: the export path renders a generated source through
//! `movie=…:format_name=lavfi`, which needs the lavfi *virtual demuxer*. That demuxer
//! is absent on this dev machine and on CI (RK-013), so `render` returns `Ok` while
//! producing **zero** frames — a generated source would make this test permanently
//! vacuous on both legs' behalf.
