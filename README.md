> **Status:** avio is pre-1.0. The API is still evolving and may change between minor versions.

## What is avio?

- **Safe by default**: every unsafe FFmpeg call is encapsulated, so application code never needs `unsafe`.
- **Ergonomic**: builder APIs, typed formats, and errors that carry human-readable context instead of raw FFmpeg return codes.
- **Two layers**: an opinionated editing engine on top of model-free FFmpeg primitives, so you can adopt the whole engine or depend on a single `ff-*` crate (see [Design Philosophy](#design-philosophy)).
- **Focused**: a foundation for video delivery services and video editing applications in Rust; it does not try to cover every FFmpeg feature.

Re-encode a video to H.264, reusing the source resolution and frame rate:

```rust
use ff_probe::open;
use ff_decode::VideoDecoder;
use ff_encode::{VideoEncoder, VideoCodec, BitrateMode};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Inspect the input and reuse its resolution and frame rate.
    let info = open("input.mp4")?;
    let video = info
        .primary_video()
        .ok_or("input.mp4 has no video stream")?;
    let (width, height, fps) = (video.width(), video.height(), video.fps());
    println!("{width}x{height} @ {fps:.2} fps");

    // A decoder for the input, an encoder for the output.
    let mut decoder = VideoDecoder::open("input.mp4").build()?;
    let mut encoder = VideoEncoder::create("output.mp4")
        .video(width, height, fps)
        .video_codec(VideoCodec::H264)
        .bitrate_mode(BitrateMode::Crf(23)) // 0-51, lower = higher quality
        .build()?;

    // Decode every frame and re-encode it.
    while let Some(frame) = decoder.decode_one()? {
        encoder.push_video(&frame)?;
    }
    encoder.finish()?; // flush buffered frames and finalize the file

    Ok(())
}
```

## Design Philosophy

avio is two layers: an opinionated editing **engine** on top of model-free FFmpeg **primitive** crates. Adopt the whole engine, or reach for a single primitive.

### avio (the engine)

`avio` commits to one editing model: tracks, a per-clip effect stack, keyframes, and compositing, with model-to-frame derivation and undo/redo history. If that model fits your app, depend on `avio`, drive `Timeline` / `Clip`, and get a preview that matches the exported result. The engine answers *what* to edit.

### FFmpeg primitive crates

The `ff-*` crates handle execution (decode, encode, filter, composite one frame, stream) and know nothing about timelines, tracks, or edits. They are model-free by construction (the editing model lives only in `avio`, at the top of the dependency graph), so nothing forces avio's model on you. Each is usable on its own: build a different editing model (a node-graph compositor, a magnetic timeline), or just do safe Rust media plumbing (decode, encode, transcode, stream). The primitives answer *how* to execute. See [`ff-decode`](./crates/ff-decode) for a decode-only example.

## Installation

Add the `avio` engine, or individual `ff-*` primitives:

```toml
[dependencies]
avio = "0.18"

# Or pick individual primitives, without the engine
ff-probe  = "0.18"
ff-decode = "0.18"
ff-encode = "0.18"
```

All crates share a single workspace version and are released together in lockstep; see [Versioning](#versioning). FFmpeg 7.x or 8.x development libraries must be installed on your system.

### Windows

```powershell
vcpkg install ffmpeg:x64-windows
$env:VCPKG_ROOT = "C:\vcpkg"
```

### macOS

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo apt install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev libswresample-dev
```

## Documentation

API documentation is on [docs.rs/avio](https://docs.rs/avio); each `ff-*` primitive is documented on its own docs.rs page (linked in [Crates](#crates)).

## Feature flags

The editing engine (`Timeline` / `Clip` / `Editor` / `render`), media probing (`open`), and analysis are always present in `avio`; the flags add opt-in capabilities on top:

| Feature | Default | Enables |
|---------|:------:|---------|
| `hwaccel` | yes | Hardware-accelerated export (NVENC, QSV, AMF, VideoToolbox, VA-API) |
| `preview` | | Real-time `TimelinePlayer` and `Scene` types |
| `serde` | | serde (de)serialization of the editing model |
| `gpl` | | GPL-only codecs (libx264, libx265) |

For standalone primitive work (a raw decoder, encoder, pipeline, stream output, or the GPU compositor), depend on the `ff-*` crate directly; each carries its own feature flags (`tokio`, `srt`, `render-gpu`, and so on).

## Versioning

All crates in this repository (`avio` and the `ff-*` family) share one workspace version, defined in `[workspace.package]` in `Cargo.toml`, and are published together. Their version numbers always move in **lockstep**; the shared version is bumped only when the crates advance as a set.

## Platform support

| Platform | Status | Hardware acceleration |
|----------|--------|-----------------------|
| Windows | ✅ | NVENC/NVDEC, QSV, AMF |
| macOS | ✅ | VideoToolbox |
| Linux | ✅ | VAAPI, NVENC/NVDEC, QSV |

## Projects using avio

### [ascii-term](https://github.com/itsakeyfut/ascii-term)

A terminal media player that renders video as colored ASCII art with synchronized audio. It was migrated from `ffmpeg-next` / `ffmpeg-sys-next` to `avio`, with no direct `unsafe` FFmpeg code in the application. It uses:

- `VideoDecoder` with `PixelFormat::Rgb24` for per-pixel luminance mapping
- `AudioDecoder` with PCM conversion (`SampleFormat::F32`) feeding [rodio](https://crates.io/crates/rodio)
- Synchronized audio and video across two threads via `crossbeam-channel`

### [avio-editor-demo](https://github.com/itsakeyfut/avio-editor-demo)

A non-linear video editor and the main driver of the library's API. It exercises the full decode, timeline compose, preview, and export path, and is where most bugs and API changes originate. It uses:

- `Timeline` / `Clip` multi-track composition with per-clip colour correction and transitions
- A real-time preview that matches the exported result
- The `ff-preview` proxy workflow, plus scene/silence detection, waveform, and EBU R128 loudness analysis
