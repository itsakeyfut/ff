# Engine and Primitives — avio's architecture

> Status: design of record. Drives tracking issues #1326 (relocation + purification) and
> #1327 (immutable model redesign). Internal doc.

## 1. Positioning decision

avio is an **editing engine**, not a general-purpose "build any editor" toolkit. The `ff-*`
family are **model-agnostic primitives**.

- **`avio` (engine)** owns the editing model: what a project/timeline/clip is, how time and
  tracks and edits and history are organised, and how a frame is derived from that model. It is
  opinionated by design (it commits to one editing model).
- **`ff-*` (primitives)** own execution: decode, encode, filter, composite one frame, interpolate,
  probe, stream. They know nothing about editing.

Why this split, honestly:

1. **Primary justification — engine correctness.** The North Star (below) can only guarantee
   "preview == export" and be testable if the primitives are stateless executors of a per-frame
   description. Purifying `ff-*` is what makes the engine correct, not a courtesy to library users.
2. **De-risks the engine's opinion.** Because clean primitives remain, an app whose editing model
   does not fit avio's can drop to `ff-*` and build its own. The separation is what makes "be an
   opinionated engine" a safe bet.
3. **Bonus — a real, modest library audience.** Safe Rust media plumbing (decode/encode/transcode/
   stream) is a genuine `ff-*` use case (e.g. ascii-term). This is a bonus, not the reason.

**Guardrail against over-engineering:** purify `ff-*` only to the depth the engine's North Star
requires. Do not gold-plate the libraries for a speculative "build your own editor" audience. The
engine's needs bound the purification scope.

## 2. North Star (target architecture)

```
immutable/declarative editing model   (avio)
        │  derive(model, t)  — a pure function
        ▼
      Scene   (a flat, model-agnostic description of one frame's work)   (ff-* type)
        │  executed by
        ▼
stateless primitives: decode / filter / composite / encode   (ff-*)
```

- The **editing model** is an immutable value. Edits produce a new version.
- **`derive(model, t) -> Scene`** is a pure function: the single source of truth for a frame.
- **preview == export by construction**: both paths call the same `derive` and the same primitive
  executor. Equality is structural, not maintained by hand.
- **Undo/Redo** is a history of immutable model versions.

The model's immutable redesign, the pure `derive`, and Do/Undo are implemented in **#1327**.
Their shape is fixed here so that #1326 purifies toward the right target.

### 2.1 The immutable model and edit API — design for #1327

The model relocated in #1326 is a build-once value (`Timeline` via `TimelineBuilder`) with no edit
or history API. #1327 makes it an immutable, editable value with Do/Undo, per the North Star above.
Confirmed design (user-approved):

- **Immutable document.** The existing `Timeline` value is reused as the immutable document (already
  `Clone`; its fields *are* the document — canvas, fps, tracks, clips, animations). An edit produces a
  new `Timeline`; the `TimelineBuilder` probe path is not re-run (edits carry the already-resolved
  canvas/fps).
- **Edit API — Command/reducer.** A `Command` enum (`AddClip`, `RemoveClip`, `MoveClip`, `TrimClip`,
  `SetClipProperty`, `AddTrack`/`RemoveTrack`, `SetCanvas`, `SetFrameRate`, …) is applied by a pure
  `apply(&Timeline, &Command) -> Result<Timeline, EditError>`. Clips/tracks are addressed by a
  `TrackId` (kind + index) plus a clip index (index-based first; stable IDs are a later enhancement).
  Making each edit a value gives first-class Do/Undo/Redo and a path to serialization / collaboration.
- **History — snapshot versions.** An `Editor { history: Vec<Timeline>, cursor }` holds the version
  history: `apply` pushes a new version (truncating the redo tail), `undo`/`redo` move the cursor.
  This is the North Star's "history of immutable versions"; structural sharing / diffs (im/rpds) are a
  later memory optimisation, not needed first.
- **Unified `derive` — staged.** Today export (`Timeline::render` → `MultiTrackComposer`) and preview
  (`Timeline::to_scene` → runner → `RealtimeComposer`) are separate derivations that share
  `Clip::video_effect_chain` but build different layer types and composers, so "preview == export" is
  not yet structural. #1327 stages this: **first** the immutable model + edit API + Do/Undo (additive,
  executors unchanged, always-green); **then** a unified pure `derive(model, t) -> Scene` (per-frame)
  with converging executors so preview == export by construction — the hardest, riskiest part, split
  into its own child issues.
- **Per-clip animation lives in the model uniformly.** Every continuous per-clip property carries its
  animation track in the model, and `derive` passes it through uniformly; a primitive may
  static-evaluate at `t=0` any track it does not yet animate (today the compositor static-evaluates
  `scale`/`rotation` and the mixer applies `pitch` as a static step, while `opacity`/`x`/`y`/`volume`
  animate), with per-frame/per-sample animation landed per-primitive as follow-up. Rationale:
  [ADR-0002](../adr/0002-per-clip-animation-in-the-model.md).

**Child issues (#1327):** **C1** `Command` + pure `apply`; **C2** `Editor` (history / undo / redo);
**C3** extract a shared `derive` core across export/preview; **C4** unified `derive(model, t) -> Scene`
+ executor convergence (its own design sub-cycle); **C5** structural-sharing history (memory, if
needed). C1/C2 are the immediate, high-value, low-risk work; C3–C5 follow.

**C4 decomposition (scope B — full visual parity):** C4 is an epic. Both compositors are FFmpeg
libavfilter graphs that already share the same lower-level builders, so "same executor" means the same
per-frame overlay/blend graph. Scope B closes the nine gaps below so preview is visually identical to
export while keeping the two executors (full per-frame-export unification, retiring `MultiTrackComposer`,
is out of scope). Children: **C4a** single `derive` backbone + video representation convergence (gaps 2, 3);
**C4b** `composite_op` in the preview executor (gap 1); **C4c** transition/xfade-kind parity (gap 8, last,
own sub-cycle); **C4d** `lavfi_overlay` in preview (gap 4); **C4e** audio derivation + preview parity
(gaps 5, 6, 7). Sequence: C4a → {C4b, C4d, C4e} → C4c.

#### C4 gap-list — where preview (`to_scene`) diverges from export (`render`) today

A field-by-field mapping (during C3) showed the two derivations diverge not just in *encoding* but in
*features*: the export path (`render` → `MultiTrackComposer`/`VideoLayer`) honours nine things the preview
path (`to_scene` → `RealtimeComposer`/`RealtimeLayerDescriptor`) silently drops. Closing these — plus
converging the two target types (`VideoLayer`'s `AnimatedValue<f64>` vs `RealtimeLayerDescriptor`'s
`value + Option<track>`, and the missing composite/scale/rotation fields) — is the concrete **C4** target
(and is a *behaviour change* for preview, so it cannot land under C3's "no behaviour change"):

1. `composite_op` (Porter-Duff) — export only.
2. `scale_x` / `scale_y` / `rotation` — export only (animation-driven).
3. Timeline-level `video_animations` / `audio_animations` maps — export only, incl. the track-level
   opacity/x/y/volume/pan fallbacks and the 3-way precedence merge (per-clip track > static > track-anim).
4. `lavfi_overlay` — export only.
5. Audio `speed` — export applies to audio; the preview audio placement has no speed.
6. `audio_effects` — export only.
7. `pan` — export only.
8. Transition **kind** (`XfadeTransition`) — export honours it; preview collapses to a duration-only fade.

The one extraction genuinely shared today is `Clip::video_effect_chain()` (eq + per-clip video effects),
consumed by export directly and by preview via `Clip::realtime_layer_descriptor`. **C3** extracted the
export per-clip interpretation into the pure `avio::derive` module (`video_layer` / `audio_track`) so it
has one testable home; **C4** makes preview derive from the same core, closing the gaps above.

**C4a (done):** both paths now build their video layer from one core. `avio::derive::video_transform`
computes the merged opacity/x/y/scale/rotation + blend + composite once; `video_layer` (export) and
`realtime_descriptor` (preview) both consume it, and `to_scene` routes through the latter. The
`RealtimeLayerDescriptor` converged to the `VideoLayer` shape (`AnimatedValue<f64>` opacity/x/y +
`scale_x`/`scale_y`/`rotation` + `composite_op`), and `build_realtime_composition` consumes the new
fields (rendering scale/rotation as static-at-t=0 nodes, matching export; `composite_op` is carried but
still rendered as `Over` until C4b). This closes gaps 2 and 3 for preview overlays. **Deferred (Q2):**
exact pixel-parity (the realtime `rgba` output vs export's `yuv420p`) and the overlay force-scale are left
to a canvas-reconciliation follow-up (#1782). The base-track (V1) placement is settled: every layer is
placed in canvas space on every route (ADR-0016), and the realtime composer composites onto a canvas-sized
accumulator rather than the base's own size.

**C4b (done):** preview renders `composite_op` (gap 1 closed). `build_realtime_composition` now dispatches
non-`Over` overlays through the shared `add_composite_step` — the same Porter-Duff *construction* the export
path and `FilterStep::Composite` use (`overlay` swap for `Under`, `blend all_expr` for In/Out/Atop/Xor), and
`add_blend_expr_step` forwards opacity via `all_opacity` to match export's construction. `eof_action` stays
export-only (the realtime buffersrc inputs are finite, not the infinite `color` canvas). Two effects fall
under the Q2 pixel-parity deferral, both rooted in the realtime graph compositing in **rgba** while export
normalises the `blend` inputs to **yuv420p**: (a) the channel-math operators (In/Out/Atop/Xor — like the
photographic blend modes, which already have this property) apply the *same operator* but evaluate it in a
different colour space, so exact pixels differ; and (b) `blend`'s `all_opacity` is planar-oriented, so on the
rgba inputs it is currently a no-op — the `all_opacity` arg is emitted for construction parity but the
expr-operator attenuation only becomes visible once the Q2 colour-space reconciliation lands. `Under`/`Over`
are alpha-composited and match export today. As with export, animated opacity/position on a non-`Over` layer
is not tracked (the static t=0 value is used).

**C4d (done):** preview composites the timeline-level `lavfi_overlay` (gap 4 closed). A new `ff_filter`
primitive `LavfiSource` builds a source-only `movie=…:format_name=lavfi → format=rgba` graph (keeping the
overlay's own alpha), carried into the `Scene` as a top-level `lavfi_overlay: Option<String>`. The runner
generates a frame per tick (held-frame model, same as file overlays) and pushes it as the topmost layer —
fixed full-frame Normal/`Over`, matching export — on both the present and gap-fill paths. **Limitation:** the
source has no seek, so on a timeline seek the generator is rebuilt from t=0; a static overlay (a drawtext
title, the dominant case) is exact, while a time-varying lavfi restarts from t=0 after a seek.

**C4e (done):** the audio derivation converged on `avio::derive::audio_volume` (the 3-way volume merge), which
both the export `audio_track` and the preview `to_scene` audio projection now share; `to_scene` threads
`audio_animations` (previously unused). Preview audio now applies the merged volume (incl. the timeline
`audio_{idx}_volume` automation), the audio-only-track `speed` (was hard-coded 1.0), and the V1-clip audio
fades and static `volume_db` (previously dropped). Note export mixes only the dedicated `audio_tracks` (not
video-clip audio), so the audio-track placements are the parity target. **Deferred (audio-Q2):** `pan` — a
no-op in the export mixer today (`build_audio_mix` computes but never applies it) — and `audio_effects` — the
preview audio path is a hand-rolled decode+resample+mix pipeline with no `FilterStep` executor. Both await a
per-track preview audio `FilterGraph` executor (the audio analogue of the video executor convergence), which
would also apply pitch-accurate `atempo` speed and realise pan in both ends.

**C4c (done, completes C4):** preview renders the export xfade *kind* (gap 8 closed). Previously every
transition rendered as a single host-side linear crossfade (`blend_rgba`); the kind was collapsed to a bool
in `video_placement`. The derived `Scene` now carries `xfade_kind: Option<XfadeTransition>` (base track
only; overlays force `None`, matching the compositor), threaded into the runner's `TransitionState`. At each
transition frame the runner already holds both frames (`rgba_a`, `rgba_b`), a scalar progress, and `w`/`h`
host-side, so a new pure `ff_preview::scene::inner::apply_xfade` dispatches on the kind over packed RGBA:
`fade`, `wipe{left,right,up,down}`, `slide{left,right,up,down}`, and `dissolve` render with real fidelity and
are covered by deterministic unit tests (no FFmpeg, no probe-gating). Preview transitions are CPU, as
export's `xfade` is CPU. **Deferred:** the geometric/mosaic kinds (`fadegrays`, `circleopen`, `circleclose`,
`pixelize`) fall back to the linear fade; exact fidelity for those and GPU-default compositing (export +
preview) are tracked in #1365.

### 2.2 GPU-default compositing bridge (#1365)

The v0.18.0 bridge adds a **third compositor path**: `ff-render`'s GPU compositor, made the default for both
preview and export with automatic CPU fallback (the two CPU compositors above stay the correctness reference).
The mapping from the derived layer set (`VideoLayer` / `RealtimeLayerDescriptor`) to `ff-render`'s
`Compositor` / `RenderGraph` lives in a `gpu`-gated `avio` module, and fallback is whole-frame (a frame runs on
CPU when any layer uses a step with no GPU node, or no adapter is present). Rationale:
[ADR-0007](../adr/0007-gpu-compositing-bridge.md); mapping contract:
[`gpu-compositing-bridge.md`](./gpu-compositing-bridge.md).

## 3. Boundary principle (model vs primitive)

**Litmus:** does this type/function need to know **TIME, TRACK, CLIP, EDIT, or HISTORY** to do
its job?

- **No** (it operates on the current frame's given data) → **primitive (`ff-*`)**.
- **Yes** → **model (`avio`)**.

| Belongs in `avio` (model) | Belongs in `ff-*` (primitive) |
|---|---|
| Timeline / Clip / tracks / clip effect stacks | FilterGraph / FilterStep |
| model → Scene derivation, preview/export orchestration | RealtimeComposer / compositor (executes a Scene) |
| TimelinePlayer / SceneRunner (consume the model) | Keyframe / Easing / Lerp / AnimationTrack (interpolation math) |
| edit history (undo) — #1327 | BlendMode / CompositeOp / XfadeTransition (enums) |
| | decode / encode / probe / stream / EncoderConfig |
| | Pipeline / VideoPipeline / … (execution pipelines) |

## 4. The `Scene` seam

`Scene` is the clean seam between engine and primitives: a flat, model-agnostic description of
**what to render for one frame** — an ordered list of layers (each: a source frame + transform +
opacity + blend + effect steps) plus the output canvas.

- It is the **output** of `derive(model, t)` and the **input** of the primitive compositor.
- It is a **primitive type** (`ff-*` side): any engine could produce a `Scene`.
- Purification means moving timeline/editorial semantics **out** of primitive inputs. For example
  today's `VideoLayer` carries `time_offset` and `in_transition` (timeline concepts); those move
  into the engine's `derive`, and the primitive layer keeps only current-frame fields.

### 4.1 The preview Scene (runner-facing) — design for #1329

The `Scene` above is per-frame (the `RealtimeComposer` input, already model-free). The **real-time
preview runner** needs a **timeline-level** Scene, because it owns decode scheduling (opening/seeking a
decoder per source and mapping the playhead to each source's frame time). A mapping of
`ff-preview`'s `SceneRunner`/`TimelinePlayer` established:

- It reads `Timeline` **only at init and `update_layout`** — via four accessors (`video_tracks()`,
  `audio_tracks()`, `frame_rate()`, `explicit_canvas()`); `run()` never touches `Timeline`.
- The deep coupling is `Clip`: it clones the whole `Clip` into `ClipState.clip` and calls
  `clip.realtime_layer(w, h, fmt)` + `clip.{opacity,volume}_track.value_at(t)` **every tick**. Everything
  `realtime_layer` needs is already primitive (`FilterStep` / `AnimationTrack` / `AnimatedValue` /
  `BlendMode`), and `RealtimeLayer` + `RealtimeComposer` are already the compositing seam.

**Decision (approved): decouple, do not move.** The runner **stays in `ff-preview`** and consumes a
primitive `Scene` instead of `Timeline`/`Clip`; only the model and its `Timeline → Scene` derivation move
to `avio`. This avoids exposing `ff-preview` internals (`MasterClock`, `SwsRgbaConverter`,
`PlayerHandle::for_timeline`) that a physical move would have forced public.

**Scene types (defined in `ff-preview`, primitive; `avio` constructs them from `Timeline`/`Clip`):**

```
Scene { fps, canvas: Option<(u32,u32)>, video_tracks: Vec<SceneVideoTrack>, audio_tracks: Vec<SceneAudioTrack> }
SceneVideoTrack { placements: Vec<ScenePlacement> }        // track 0 = V1 base, 1.. = overlays (index = composite order)
ScenePlacement  { source: PathBuf, offset: Duration, in_point: Duration,
                  out_point: Option<Duration>, speed: f64, xfade_dur: Duration (V1 only),
                  opacity: f32, layer: RealtimeLayerDescriptor,
                  fade_in/fade_out: Duration, volume_db: f64,
                  volume_track: Option<AnimationTrack<f64>> }
SceneAudioTrack { placements: Vec<SceneAudioPlacement> }
SceneAudioPlacement { source: PathBuf, offset, in_point, out_point: Option<Duration>,
                      fade_in/fade_out: Duration, volume_db: f64,
                      volume_track: Option<AnimationTrack<f64>> }
```

- **Model projection, not media resolution.** `Scene` carries only the editing model's primitivised
  fields (`offset`, `out_point`, `speed`, …). Resolving them against the media — probing for
  duration / `has_audio` / frame size — stays in the preview runner's `open()`, exactly as today. So a
  Scene re-derived on every edit needs no re-probe, and behaviour is preserved (probe timing and error
  surface unchanged).
- `RealtimeLayerDescriptor` = `RealtimeLayer` minus `width`/`height`/`pixel_format` (a new `ff-filter`
  primitive); the runner builds the per-frame layer at decode time via
  `RealtimeLayer::with_dimensions(descriptor, w, h, fmt)`. `Clip::realtime_layer` splits into
  `Clip → RealtimeLayerDescriptor` (avio) + `descriptor → RealtimeLayer` (ff-filter).
- `PlayerCommand::UpdateLayout(Box<Timeline>)` → `UpdateLayout(Box<Scene>)`;
  `PlayerHandle::update_timeline` → `update_scene`. `avio` re-derives a `Scene` on edit and the runner
  reconciles it (as `update_layout_in_place` does today).
- After the move, `ff-preview`'s only `ff_pipeline` use is `proxy/` (primitive `Pipeline`/`EncoderConfig`)
  — it drops the model dependency entirely.

**Slices for #1329:** **A** (ff-filter) `RealtimeLayerDescriptor` + `with_dimensions`; **B** (ff-preview)
`Scene` types + runner consumes `Scene` (temporary `Timeline → Scene` adapter keeps it green); **C**
(avio) move `Timeline`/`Clip`/derivation + the two `PipelineError` model variants to `avio` and place the
`Timeline → Scene` derivation there; **D** close-out (folds into #1333).

## 5. Crate roles and dependency direction (new)

```
ff-sys → ff-common → ff-format → ff-probe / ff-decode / ff-encode / ff-remux → ff-filter
       → ff-pipeline → ff-stream / ff-preview / ff-render → ffx (facade) → avio (engine, top)

ff-decode → ff-analysis   (media analysis reads decoded frames; sits above ff-decode)
```

- **The editing model lives at the top (`avio`).** Nothing in `ff-*` depends on it, so `ff-*` are
  structurally model-free — the separation is enforced by dependency direction, not discipline.
- `avio` stops being a facade-only crate. It defines the editing-model types (and, in #1327, the
  derivation, immutable state, and undo). It still re-exports the model-facing primitive types.
- **`ffx` is the primitive-family facade (ADR-0008).** It aggregates the whole `ff-*` family under
  namespaced modules (`ffx::decode`, `ffx::filter`, `ffx::render`, ...) with Bevy-style feature
  gating (a lightweight `default` core; `render`/wgpu, `preview`, `analysis`, `stream`, `serde`,
  `hwaccel`, `gpl` behind features). **`avio` depends only on `ffx`**, forwarding its features; the
  `ff-*` crates and their inter-dependencies are unchanged (the facade is purely additive). This
  keeps `avio` the engine, not the facade (ADR-0004 holds), and gives the family a single boundary
  for a future two-repository split (engine vs primitives), which is deferred to its own milestone.
- Versioning: **independent per-crate** as of v0.16.0 (tokio/`http`-style — each crate's version
  reflects its own change cadence, so a stable `ff-format` can reach 1.0 while `ff-filter` iterates
  at 0.x; see `docs/roadmap/v0-16-0/ROADMAP.md`). Lockstep through v0.15.x.

## 6. Project decomposition

- **#1326 (first): relocation + purification.** Move the model to `avio`; purify `ff-*` into
  stateless `Scene` executors; behaviour preserved. Closeable when `ff-*` hold no editing
  semantics. Classification-first, always-green, verified by tests + the `avio-examples` harness.
- **#1327 (after): immutable model redesign.** Rebuild the now-relocated model as an immutable
  value with pure `derive` and Do/Undo. Its own design/spec cycle.

## 7. Non-goals

- Not a framework for **every** editing paradigm. avio commits to a track + per-clip effect stack
  + keyframe + compositing model. Node-based (Nuke-style) and magnetic-timeline (FCPX-style)
  models are out of scope for the engine; such apps use `ff-*` directly.
- No gold-plating of `ff-*` beyond what the engine needs (see the guardrail in §1).

## 8. CLAUDE.md changes (applied in P1-0)

- Remove "`avio` = facade / `pub use` only / no new types".
- State: `avio` = engine crate that owns the editing model; `ff-*` = model-agnostic primitives.
- Add the boundary principle (litmus) and the purification guardrail.
- Restate the dependency direction with the editing model at the top (`avio`).
- Note the "define types in the lowest applicable crate" rule now has one deliberate exception:
  the editing model is defined in `avio` (the top), because model-freeness of `ff-*` must be
  enforced by dependency direction.

## 9. Primitive expressiveness — keeping the model space wide

Two multi-agent audits (2026-08-17) checked the boundary in **both** directions:

- **Separation (are `ff-*` model-free?)** — zero structural editing-model leaks across all 11 `ff-*`
  crates; the model lives only in `avio`. Residual findings were naming/doc only (#1374, #1375).
- **Buildability (can `ff-*` host *any* editing model?)** — every paradigm the §7 non-goal points at
  (track-based, trackless/magnetic, node-graph, frame-based) is buildable, and op coverage is strong
  (blend / keying / masks / colour / transform / transition / keyframe / audio-mix). But the primitives
  are a **closed, fixed-shape** op set rather than an **open, general graph**, so node-heavy
  (Resolve/Fusion) and highly-extensible (AviUtl / Premiere-plugin) editors hit expressiveness ceilings.
  Tracked in #1379 (`FilterStep::Raw` #1376, graph fan-out/DAG #1377, composition-as-source #1378, plus
  keyframe-any-param, audio bus routing, frame-exact addressing).

**Why this matters:** the *engine* (`avio`) commits to one model (§7), but `ff-*` are meant to host
*other* models directly. That generality is currently preserved by **discipline** (the model stays in
`avio`), not guaranteed — and it is **not** automatically preserved as features grow.

**Design principle — adding a feature must not narrow the buildable model space.** Growth can shrink
generality even while nominally additive:

| Move | Effect on the model space |
|---|---|
| Add a leaf op (filter / blend / effect) | Neutral-to-widening (additive) |
| Add an **open mechanism / escape hatch** (raw filter, DAG, generic `(node, param)` keyframe) | **Widens** — prefer this |
| Add a **model-flavoured convenience type** (a `Track` / `Clip` / `ripple` / magnetic-snap / `Timeline` primitive) | **Narrows** — reject; keep in `avio` (litmus §3) |
| Add a **fixed-shape special-case** for one editor (another `*Animated` variant, a track-privileging `Scene` field) | Accretes model bias; defers the general case — prefer generalising |
| **Publish** a closed shape (v0.16.0 independent versioning) | Crystallises it; narrows future widening — open the substrate before broad adoption |

**Rule: when adding a capability, open the substrate rather than encode one model's convenience.** Apply
the litmus (§3) to every new primitive; keep the low-level `FilterGraph` / composer first-class so
non-track models are not forced through a `Scene` that privileges tracks; and treat *"can a track / node
/ trackless mini-pipeline still be built on `ff-*`?"* as a standing regression question.
