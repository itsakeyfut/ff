//! Verify that the real-time preview and the export agree: drive one timeline through
//! `TimelinePlayer` and through `Timeline::render`, and compare what each produced.
//!
//! `crates/avio/tests/preview_export_parity.rs` makes this claim inside the crate. This
//! script makes it from outside, through the public facade a consumer has: the preview's
//! only output channel is the sink `SceneRunner::set_sink` takes, so a consumer has to
//! be able to name and implement `FrameSink` for the preview to be observable at all.
//!
//! The clip carries a non-neutral `ColorCorrect`, so an effect reaches both pipelines
//! rather than both merely copying frames through.
//!
//! What is compared: the frame size, the number of frames, the span the preview covered,
//! and the colour of each frame against the export's frame at the same index. Frame by
//! frame rather than over the sequence: the fixture sweeps a full hue circle, so its
//! sequence average is achromatic and a per-channel divergence would cancel out in it
//! (the average measures spread 1.3, below this script's own blank-frame threshold).
//!
//! Not per-pixel convergence, which is out of scope for v0.18: the preview composites in
//! rgba while the export normalises to `yuv420p`, and the export is measured after a
//! lossy encode, so the two land on different numbers for reasons that have nothing to
//! do with a regression.
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo run -p avio-examples --bin preview_matches_export
//! cargo run -p avio-examples --bin preview_matches_export -- --input clip.mp4 --keep
